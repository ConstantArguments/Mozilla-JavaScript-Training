  An object is made up of multiple members, each of which has a name (e.g. name and age above), and a value (e.g. ['Bob', 'Smith'] and 32).
  Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon.
  The syntax always follows this pattern:
    var objectName = {
      member1Name: member1Value,
      member2Name: member2Value,
      member3Name: member3Value
    };

        last: "Smith"
      },
      age: 32,
      gender: "male",
      interests: ["music", "skiing"],
      bio: function() {
        alert(
