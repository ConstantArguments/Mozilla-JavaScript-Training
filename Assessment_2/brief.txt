You have been provided with some HTML, CSS and image assets and a few lines of JavaScript code; you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program.

The most interesting parts of the example's CSS file:
  * Absolutely position the three elements inside the full-img <div> â€” the <img> in which the full-sized image is displayed, an empty <div> that is sized to be the same size as the <img> and put right over the top of it (this is used to apply a darkening effect to the image via a semi-transparent background color), and a <button> that is used to control the darkening effect.
  * Set the width of any images inside the thumb-bar <div> (so-called "thumbnail" images) to 20%, and float them to the left so they sit next to one another on a line.

Your JavaScript needs to:
  * Loop through all the images, and for each one insert an <img> element inside the thumb-bar <div> that will embed that image in the page.
  * Attach an onclick handler to each <img> inside the thumb-bar <div> so that when they are clicked, the corresponding image will be displayed in the displayed-img <img> element.
  * Attach an onclick handler to the <button> so that when it is clicked, a darken effect is applied to the full-size image. When it is clicked again, the darken effect is removed again.
