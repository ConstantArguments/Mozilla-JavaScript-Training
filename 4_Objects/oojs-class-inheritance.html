    <h1>This is a Javascript Exercise on Objects and Inheritance</h1>
    <pre>
        Try Entering the following (one at a time):

        teacher1.name.first;
        teacher1.interests[0];
        teacher1.bio();
        teacher1.subject;
        teacher1.greeting();
        teacher1.farewell();

        Then substitute "teacher" for "student" or "person".

        There are a total of 3 teachers, 3 students, and 5 persons.

        Note: Only teachers have subjects.

  /*
  The constructor function is JavaScript's version of a class. You'll notice that it has all the features you'd expect in a function,
  although it doesn't return anything or explicitly create an object — it basically just defines properties and methods.
  You'll see the this keyword being used here as well — it is basically saying that whenever one of these object instances is created,
  the object's name property will be equal to the name value passed to the constructor call, and
  the greeting() method will use the name value passed to the constructor call too.

  Note: A constructor function name usually starts with a capital letter —
  this convention is used to make constructor functions easier to recognize in code.

  Note: It is a fairly common pattern for more object definitions is to define the properties inside the constructor,

  the property definitions, and the methods are split off into separate blocks.
